This is the back-end ruling a fleet of [NOAuth Discord bots](https://github.com/newtondotcom/noauth-discord). ðŸš€
It is also connected to the [NOAuth MasterD](https://github.com/newtondotcom/noauth-masterd) which is the small container orchestrator to spin up [NOAuth Discord bot](https://github.com/newtondotcom/noauth-discord) when a user subscribes to it, as well as updating the docker image. ðŸ”§
